/**
  * All instructions for publishing to sonatype can be found on the sbt-plugin page:

  *
  * and some here:
  *
  * https://github.com/xerial/sbt-sonatype
  *
  * VERY IMPORTANT!!! You need to add credentials as described here:
  * http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Using-Sonatype.html#Second+-+Configure+Sonatype+integration
  *
  * The username and password are the same as those to the Sonatype JIRA account.
  * https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-33718
  *
  * And then you need to ensure PGP keys to sign the maven artifacts:
  * http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Using-Sonatype.html#PGP+Tips%E2%80%99n%E2%80%99tricks
  * Which means that you need to have PGP installed
  *
  * To avoid pushing sensitive information to github you must put all PGP related things in your local configs:
  * as described here:
  *
